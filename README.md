# Delftia_makes_golds


The bacteria "DELFTIA" believed to makes golds (the web sites and some articles says that), <br>
and I was occationally under the mission that searching delftia from shotgun sequences.<br>
Of course the true mission was an another (.. ), I had to search shaperone of heat shock protein 60 (HP60) from derived bacteria protein annotated by pfam or refseq, etc.<br>
It might be realted to the Kawasa.. disease, and actually I found delftia was increased siginificantlly in the results of in 16S ribosomal sequcences pipeline.<br>
However the shotgun sequcencing result was FALSE.<br>
I would continue to support that(her) research until that will becomes true, but I could not becuase of the end of the time, in just 3 wks.<br>
